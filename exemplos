<h1>My name is Jasmine.I am a Computer Science Student. I am Developer. I am an Adventure. I am a Trojan. I am an Innovator. I am a UI/UX Designer.</h1>

<p>
    Born in Hong Kong, studied aboard in New Zealand, and briefly ventured into Australia, I am currently starting a new chapter in Los Angeles, California, pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC).
</p>

<p>
    My journey as a developer began during lockdown when I took Tap Tap Kaboom's class and built a one-page Minions wikipedia. Fast forward to today, I have had the privilege of interning as a Software Engineer at Serato, the world's best DJ and music production software company, designing and developing websites for startups and non-profits, and winning multiple hackathons and start-up incubators.
</p>
<p>
    I am passionate about all things technology, especially front-end software development, project management, and UI/UX design, and I am a firm believer in placing humanity in the centre of technology.
</p>
<p>This site is proudly awarded the CSSDA (CSS Design Awards) Special Kudos Award and Best UI, UX & Innovation Award. </p>
